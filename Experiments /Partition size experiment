## Partition size benchmarking

The following experiment tries to find if the size of the partition will affect the time between the moment the moment the item is split and the moment when the node receives their chunk. The purpose of this experiment is to confirm or refute if our idea of implementing dynamic sizes was a good idea or not, and if a much simpler solution would lead to the same results.

#### 3 ) Results

The results indicate that the smaller the file size the longer it will take to distribute, because of the overhead it creates the need to split a file into smaller files, and establishing a connection for each small file. It is also worth noting that the dynamic file size works great and scales, so the performance provided would apply regardless of the file size (given that the dynamic size has no upper cap).
