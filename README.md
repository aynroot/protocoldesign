prepare -p <port1>
prepare -p <port2>
tornet -p <port> <files dir> <nodes list>

<port> -- on which port to bind the tracker
<port1>, <port2> -- on whic ports to bind the p2p nodes that accepts the chunks
<files dir> -- absolute path to the directory with peered files
<nodes list> --  a list of nodes in format IP:PORT separated by spaces (use nodes which run 'prepare')

tip: put files you need to distribute in the folder _other_ than pft-files (i.e. tornet-files)
     to avoid problems with serving files that start with underscore


after tornet terminates, you will have chunks on each node that have run 'prepare' + torrent files generated (torrent-files/*)
stop 'prepare' process on nodes


# tornet

run two nodes that store the chunks
and one more node that downloads the specific file
for example:
    p2p_node.go -p 4466
    p2p_node.go -p 4467
    p2p_node.go -p 4468 torrent-files/test.pdf.torrent
